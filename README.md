The Crygeen project has not been launched before. I apologize. I had an error in the file path. There are still various bugs there, but I fix them whenever possible. I tested on Windows, everything should work if you have scripts allowed to run. setup.sh also works. If there are any problems, then maybe you did something wrong. Make sure that the PATH is specified correctly and venv has been created, as well as the necessary libraries have been loaded. Also make sure that you have bent the correct branch. the master branch should be the most stable, the rest are in development, so if you decide to clone them, then do it at your own risk, as some of the files may be missing. You can write to me about all the problems in private messages in telegram (@Harlok13)

  <p>
This program demonstrates a simple game menu using the Pygame library.
The menu is composed of several buttons with different hover effects.
When a button is hovered over, it fades in and when the mouse is moved
away, it fades out. The program is also able to play/background music
during menu animation.
